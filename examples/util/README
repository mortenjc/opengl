	texture.c and texture.h:

	The lack of a library and Makefile is deliberate. We're trying
	to keep the code machine independent. Just compile with the
	source code. Here's a sample compile line:

	LIBS = -lglut -lGLw -lGLU -lGL -lXmu -lXt -lX11 -lm

	sample: sample.c ../Util/texture.h ../Util/texture.c
		cc $(CFLAGS) -o $@ sample.c ../Util/texture.c $(LIBS)

	To use the code in your program is easy. First put in
	the header file:

	#include "../Util/texture.h"

	Then just make the following call:

	unsigned *teximage; /* pointer to texture data */
	int texwid, texht; /* dimensions of texture that was read */
	int texcomps; /* number of components in external format */

	teximage = read_texture(filepath, &texwid, &texht, &texcomps);

	Now you can load the texture very easily:

	glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, internal_format, texwid, texht, 0,
                    GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, teximage);
